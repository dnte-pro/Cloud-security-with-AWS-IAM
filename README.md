This beginner AWS project focuses on strengthening cloud security by learning and applying AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) best practices.
It was originally designed as part of the NextWork AWS Beginner Projects series.

📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to understand how to manage users, groups, roles, and permissions in AWS using IAM, ensuring secure and controlled access to cloud resources.

By completing this project, you’ll gain hands-on experience with access control, policies, and authentication mechanisms in AWS.

🛠️ Services Used

AWS IAM → Create and manage users, groups, and roles.

AWS Management Console → For IAM configurations.

AWS CLI (optional) → For command-line practice with IAM.
